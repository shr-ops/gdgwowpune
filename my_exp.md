# My Experience at GDG WOW Pune

## What I Learned

During the GDG WOW Pune event, we had the opportunity to learn about several cutting-edge technologies and concepts:

- **MCP (Multi-Agent Conversational AI Platform)**: We explored how multiple AI agents can work together to solve complex problems.
  
- **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**: Learned how combining retrieval systems with generative AI can create more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

- **Prompt Engineering**: Discovered techniques to effectively communicate with AI models to get the desired outputs.

- **LLM Applications**: Explored various practical applications of Large Language Models in business and everyday scenarios.

- **Vector Databases**: Understood how vector databases store and retrieve unstructured data for AI applications.

## Hands-on Workshops

The hands-on workshops were especially valuable, allowing us to:

- Build a simple RAG system using open-source tools
- Implement effective prompting strategies
- Collaborate with other participants on mini-projects

## Networking Opportunities

The event provided excellent opportunities to connect with:
- Industry professionals
- Fellow developers
- Google Developer Experts

## Looking Forward

I'm excited to apply what I've learned to my projects and continue exploring the fascinating world of AI and machine learning with the GDG WOW Pune community.
